    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Chicken Afritada, also known as Apritadang Manok, is another classic tomato sauce-based dish adapted from Spanish cuisine. The origin of this delicious Filipino dish dates back during the colonial era (1521-1898) of Spain in the Philippines. In fact, Afritada was derived from the Spanish word "fritada" which means "fried".</p>
